85,neutral,alright its okay but it freezes all the time

103,positive,really like this app allows me to both catalog my collection and display and sort my collection to make it easier for friends to decide what they want to watch.  i recommend you get the pro version. it's diverse features and ability to access your database from any of your appliances or computers is a blessing. the ability to modify the meta data stored for your movies would be good as sometimes the data is miss classified or incorrectly genred
104,positive,i really like this game!!!!!! this is a good game!!!!

109,positive,it is fun i love it
110,positive,best twitter client! if you are looking for the best twitter client  search no more. this is it! it's similar to tweetbot on ios. you get all the great features from pull to refresh  inline images  column views  white/black holo theme background  tap to jump to top  and so much more. oh and there are no ads in this version. it is simply amazing.
111,negative,holy crap i lack the words to describe just how amazing this is on 4.1+. seriously  i've tried to explain it to people who haven't used it  and i just can't. i fail as an orator.  pretty pointless on older android versions though. although i have to wonder what the typical 1 star trolls are going on about battery use. the amount of my battery this uses is almost nonexistent. and complaining that an optional opt-in feature is running in the background when its entire purpose is to run in the background is just stupid.
112,positive,? best military game on android  accuracy kit and guns.

140,positive,a superb app i came to android about a year ago from an iphone  and i tried every reddit client out there such as baconreader and reddit news. these were all good apps  but none of them compared to my experience with alienblue. then  i tried reddit sync and it has become almost exclusively the only way i read redditch anymore. the holo interface and black night mode are easy on my eyes and it has all of the features i need.
141,neutral,? ok  preferred the last version but this is ok.

148,positive,awesome it's a good app
149,positive,cool game this game is awesome
150,positive,average no doubt the art work of the game is original and fits the environment well  but that alone does not make a good title. the gameplay is interesting but lacks a real reason to come back or be played over another game. the split screen in the only feature that stood out but even then it got boring quickly. i liked the game  thought it was promising  but a lack of ideas to keep me playing made the experience fall short.
151,positive,this is really good this app is really good

188,positive,"great potential. great start. a week ago i replaced my razr with the note 3. i really miss ""smart actions"" by motorola. this app needs a lot more triggers and actions. i rarely use a headset and when i plug in the charger all i need it to do is charge the battery. all i use now is the time to silence the phone as needed. could use location  network and speed (for care mode) triggers . i sincerely hope the developer continues to add features. once it's up to speed i wouldn't mind paying for it."

""notes"" space is useful for more detail/info associated with a specific day's task. so many ways this can be used to track time spent on tasks and projects for business  personal  family  pleasure  etc."

246,positive,awseom unique innovative and just awesome
247,positive,? the bonus is really great
248,positive,superb! thanks dev for making it free!
249,positive,amazing this is freaking great
250,negative,simply the best i very rarely write reviews. even more rare is when i like an app enough to buy it. this app deserves both. i have  seriously  tried most music players for the android and this one has everything i need. audio engine is tops  start and stop via headphone jack  great album art download. lots of other programs have these things but either lack in these or other features. i especially like the simple issue of bass and treble control. price a little high  that was the only thing holding me back from buying it sooner. was thinking of giving it 4 stars because of price but; what the heck- i gave it five.
251,positive,i like t this game is cool
252,positive,? omg i love this app!!! he is too cute.. or is it a she??
253,positive,galaxy ace india is greatest
254,positive,woooow it is gooooooood game:-) :-) :-)
255,positive,love it it's excellent
256,positive,? what is the best the best thing to scan?
257,negative,for an older version maybe  the pack is bad now i know.
258,negative,bleh channels won't play and poor genre selection  no holiday or otr.
259,positive,worth the bandwidth to download :-) unique and limitless
260,positive,super bright it is soooooooooooo bright
261,positive,best. easy to use and werry helpfull
262,neutral,? guns by calford is better
263,positive,lovely! this is lovely apk.
264,positive,ausome this game is really a good game but very advertisements are there
265,positive,excellent you can change your car s  it's easy to park it self
266,positive,? fun and trouble free
267,positive,excellent app! but add more! this is much better than samsung's equation detection but the only thing missing in this app is the lack of variety. just like in the note 10.1  please add more equations and have the ability to solve complex algebra. i'll be glad to pay for such a feature. makes work so much easier!
268,negative,suggestions  comprehensive an incredibly solid start. there are some quirks and bugs (that aren't suuuper major) and an overall lack of features  but the base here is startlingly fresh and good. the lack of gesture support and more icon customization  as well as a way to hide the settings page (tucking it away in a gesture  overflow menu somewhere  or separate app shortcut) make it difficult to leave nova launcher. here are my suggestions  and what it would take to make me switch:  - customize app icons on long-press  individually. applying a theme is great  but they rarely cover 100% of all apps  and the inconsistency drives me mad.  - gesture support. i love being able to swipe down anywhere and pulling down my notification shade  or swiping up for my app drawer  etc.  - customization of panels. i'd like to be able to decide if i want a full apps list  or the launcher settings  and be able to decide where they are located.  i have already purchased the pro key  so i'm excited to see if these features get implemented. i currently run a custom setup i made for myself in nova launcher mimicking the google now aesthetic  but having it in launcher form would be 10x better. good luck!
269,positive,gets the job done i was a handyshopper user and  although i miss being able to record aisles and prices for many stores for one item  i love that i can add something to the shopping list with my phone and my husband can see it immediately on his phone.  i also like that out of milk has a web site where i can build a list  so when i'm planning meals for the week  i can be building the list too using a regular keyboard.  i see the value of the pantry option.  i'll probably be using it to keep an inventory of our freeer and our spices.  i would like to see a way to add items to more than one list.  for example  i'd like chips to be on the costco list and the snack list so if i'm shopping at one store and see a great price  i'd know i needed chips.  overall  thisi app gets the job done and it's popularity makes me think the features i want may be added some day.
270,positive,just great excellent i wish it had the black list feature
271,positive,great apps works well and looks great. lots of available providers. from the 5 or so apps i've tested  deliveries seems to support the most.  i submitted a bug report when statuses from one of the providers wasn't working as expected. the developer promptly got back to me and fixed the issue.   only feature i would like is auto-detection of provider based on the tracking number. but as a fellow programmer i understand the challenges presented by such a feature  so this doesn't affect my rating.
272,positive,? easy to use and simple but miss some features like changing color or font for multiple nodes
273,negative,blech. horrible lack of features and customization. good for only occasional typing  i guess.
274,positive,excellent app no complaints at all but still waiting for urdu localization
275,negative,offline browsing please allow us to open local html or swf files.  there are few browsers out there that can not play local html but those lack the browsing/playing features of this app.
276,negative,airplane mode :/ i know you can't do anything about it  but the lack of airplane mode scheduling in kitkat just sucks. other features are very useful.
277,neutral,flash i don't have flash and i don't know how to get it
278,neutral,"excellent app for galaxy s4 the major lack (to me) on my gs4 is that the home screen will not rotate to landscape mode. this app resolves the problem.  i have a feature request: the app has to be manually started each time the phone restarts  then the setting has to be selected  then the ""close"" button selected.   an autostart option with a selectable default mode would make this the ideal app."
279,positive,a beautiful and efficient app with one glaringly annoying flaw... this is what got me to a smartphone in the first place  and it remains the best of the best. i miss the labs features  but i like the current incarnation. thanks for putting the scale bar back in but why does it disappear? a map (especially one that zooms and pans) needs a scale bar. keep it visible and i can give you back that 5th star.
280,positive,please just bring back the old maps!! how do you update a software and take away all the good features  while not adding any new ones?  i miss so many things.  the button that shows my entire route in nav  the option for other routes  the option to search while in nav for things in my route  the option to just view the map while nav is still running separately.  i use the gps a lot for work and this update is killing me.  i need old version of maps please
281,positive,an excellent offline rss reader on my nexus 7. a solid  simple  lightweight reader. the only feature i miss compared with my desktop reader is the ability to group feeds in folders. thanks are due to the author.  this is an open source program and there are similar apps based on it. if you have one of these installed  as i had  uninstall it first or you get a 'duplicate' error.  this is not a web-based reader like google reader  but you can import your feeds as an opml file.
282,positive,nice but it is nice but when it log we cannot take picture
283,neutral,should add more filters filters are a little lame and don't suit my pictures. if you add more filters  i'll rate it 5 stars &lt;3 and you should add more fonts  and unique features unlike other editing apps.
284,neutral,good application best news application  it should add a feature of notification also @-}--
285,positive,far from as cool as smartglass i went with a ps4 rather than the xbox one  but i do miss smart glass. they need to make this app enable the voice features  and things like the store should be built-in  not a browser link.
286,positive,excellent really great app  much better than other bus apps. the data is sometimes poor  but this is not the app's fault. looses 1 star as it occasionally force closes on launch (but isn't really a problem as it auto-reloads).   feature requests: buses moving along the google maps in real time; colour in times that i can easily walk to (from current gps) in green  ones i have to run to in orange and ones i'll miss in red.
287,neutral,one thing missing i really like this app. simple user interface and works smoothly. espn should add a feature to notify you when your current selection is finished. that is the only thing missing.
288,positive,good but lacking all in all the app works  but its pretty lack-luster. it does a few things well and a few ok  like the feed  friends list and adding  messaging  and connecting to your ps4 for second display features. but it stops there. the store takes you a external browser  the second screen features are limited and the keyboard is a bit buggy and only works 70% of the time  its slow and the positioning of things is not efficient. the ui isn't all that intuitive with its lack of gestures and easily accessible features.
289,neutral,good good app  could do with more size customisations for the widget.
290,positive,awesome great game  but in the next update y'all should add a bet with cash feature
291,positive,only 4 stars i love this app. i am able to save all of my pdf and epub documents. i only have it 4 stars because when in night mode is it very sensitive and if touched wrong the entire screen will turn the lettering black and i have to re-install the app. please work on brightness feature.
292,positive,lack some features please provide option for marking notifications as read or unread also option for commenting on post using picture
293,negative,lack of important functions 1/ you can not select multiple images to send at once in this same application. 2/ you can not send photos to friends they didn't move to telegram yet. 3/ no option for copying a fragment of a message. 4/ no automatic sending of any media if the connection is established again (you have to do it manually). not to mention that these features are available in whatsapp. implement these and you will be a serious challenger and gain 5 stars.
294,positive,"great app but not perfect if i were reviewing comixology the service  i'd give it five stars. however  this is for the android app  and for that  i can only give it three.  i'd used the ipad app  with it's great ""hd"" support  which is lacking on some android tablets.  that's not a major issue  but the biggest drawback to the app is the lack of sd support.  a majority of tablets have the option for sd cards  expanding their storage space  and many apps can take advantage of it.  it's a shame comixology's app hasn't been able to do this yet.  i don't know if it's concerns over security  if someone could take the books on the card and copy them elsewhere  but seriously  it's easy enough to copy files from system memory if you look it up.  give users the option to save to sd cards and this review will jump to five stars."
295,positive,okay but lack some features some features i would love to see is the ability to log in and being able to see the ratings and comments on memes kinda like the ios version
296,positive,excellent calculator this is an excellent floating calculator  in spite of some (minor) shortcomings. it has all the features that one would want in a small calculator that can be used while one is using other apps. the lack of memory functions is easily overcome with the use of parentheses  and with these  the copy function is more than adequate for most purposes. one useful feature which it does not have at the moment  is the ability to paste/insert data copied from  say  a text file. this would make it possible to use earier results stored in a text file. nevertheless  this is an excellent app  and the developer should be congratulated for a job well done  and for generously making it available a no cost.
297,positive,improving rapidly. this app used to be crappy while the service was ok  but recently the app has started receiving updates on a regular basis adding a lot of basic functionality that should have been there from the beginning. now it features landscape support  resume from last position  notification bar controls and save to sd card. however  i still sorely miss a decent widget  easily sortable queues or the extensions found in the desktop app.
298,negative,features and new color theme awful. i really hate the new android color  or lack thereof. the blue was fine  and i'm pretty upset you guys got rid of it. bring back the blue  and the punctuation on long-pressing the period! and why is the keyboard shrinking when i switch to symbols?!
299,positive,very good but can you add download all attachment as zip option ?  we miss this very nice feature which is available in web version.
300,positive,great customization  but old and outdated the keyboard has excellent customization  but it lack a feature to learn new words automatically  and the ui are old
301,positive,great app! i love this app! it's great to have my book lists with me wherever i go and i can easily keep track of which books i've read to each of my kids. one thing missing is the browse feature like the apple version has; i miss that! add that and i will rate 5 stars!
302,positive,very easy and fun not many programs deserve a 5 star but this is one of them. i do miss some features (or maybe i just don't know how to use the app) like continue reading from my last page ad it sometimes reloads from start with me articles but overall this is a very good app. thanks guys!
303,positive,"too slow. app is slower than mobile site and/or competing livejournal apps  like""eljay"" (search the marketplace for it). what with the lack of features even in the main pc site  it's proof that livejournal is no match for even the much maligned facebook...rip livejournal."
304,negative,what if you added a  feature to estimate your calories. when i miss a day (always horrible) the app assumes i ate nothing that day and my weekly nutrition does not include that day. the ability to assume an average of calories based on previous days would be incredibly helpful.
305,positive,great launcher what a nice launcher  should add locker feature
306,neutral,cant read japanese if ur not japanese u can read it. put it in english so we can understand it.
307,positive,need to add a feature you guys should add a custom car builder feature where you can just build your own car but every part you buy will just keep adding up your total overall great app its fun and it kills time
308,neutral,x( works but wish it could send pictures and text. its too simple. they should add features to be like voxer!
309,positive,beautiful widget. only problem i think is inspite of turning gps off  the app is continuously using it as shown by my battery usage statistics.
310,positive,excellent!! everything is awesome but so far i have found that whenever i turn on wifi my battery drains after using this software... may it happens due to widgets or panel. but if i turn off it doesn't happen.
311,negative,poor bakvas interface and very very slow app.
312,negative,this app is a waste of time. i can log in but it always freezes and eventually crashes. i do not feel confident with the security on this app if wf can leave us hanging with a horrible app for such a big bank. uninstalled htc one
313,positive,bugs in latest update great app until last update that drain battery and continue to use huge amount of data at the background...
314,positive,app is slow it it not well organized the categories like shooters there is only one witch is incorrect and its slow it freezes scrolling is glitchy etc.
315,positive,amazing! awesome app for mathematics. worth thousand starts. thanks devs. though the ui is hard to understand. thanks for the small size
316,negative,battery emptied my battery for 50% in 1 hour while phone was in standby. don't know how but had to remove in immediately. sorry.
317,positive,good app great launcher.  i really like it but it is killing my battery.
318,negative,great alarm  but has new bug making it use lots of battery i like this alarm  i definitely like being able to wake up to a random playlist. but since an update its now using massive amounts of battery using the gps. i'm guessing it's something to do with sunrise feature. i don't use the sunrise alarm and i certainly don't move between countries enough for it to constantly be updating. so either a setting to not allow access to gps or to only update once a day would be useful. otherwise i'll have to go back to the standard alarm until it's fixed.
319,negative,addictive freezes sometimes. annoying having to wait for the lives to recharge
320,negative,i love it   but i would love to make this my default sms app i'm an old textra and chomp user.  only gripe is need a lot of improvement like bubble chats even u don't make it bubble it's ok just have a bit of space bet messages cause it is confusing and cluttered to look at.  then also led notification that's one thing that keeps me from using. this as a. daily driver. .  we need better notifications..  this app is worth 5.stars i'd even buy it if it had a price. just to have it full featured. and also text counts on icon
321,positive,very fun!! worth the memory.   :-d
322,negative,? horrible on moment. my battery dies faster !
323,positive,? eats battery life like the cookie monster eats cookies. has the most features of any other system app. slows the system to a crawl. unistalled.
324,positive,excellent app but drains battery this app works really well and does exactly what's it says it does the only problem i had was that it drained my battery a lot cause it is constantly running.
325,positive,there is room for improvement... the good thing  it lets you know when your moga (pro) has been connected to your android device and it displays current games that support the controller. the bad thing: a.its interface. it's boring  even my 14yr old cousin can make it look like tegra zone-based stylish themed or better. b.the bluetooth connection. when i'm using the game  the controller loses the connection with it for too long so i have to press the moga button and try to reconnect;or it happens for a few seconds and while i'm using the controller  my notification keeps showing the controller has been connected to my tablet. c.the moga pivot connects the controller to the android device  but why on earth does it not display the controller battery life? how much longer can my controller's built-in battery last? it should let me know. d.just let me know whenever a new game has support for the controller. i'm talking about pivot running in the background  self-updating its catalog and pushing a notification warning me a new game has entered the 'supported games' list. it'd be great. e.sometimes the controller takes too long to connect. what's with the hold up? please fix these issues. they are worth a new update.
326,positive,great game its an amazing game but 4-1 ie impossible i know how to do it but there is such a small chance of doing it and for 3-7 you flick the battery to the plain box and the on the left side do the colours it said on the right and you do it for the otherside. everytime you get it right you should hear a ding of some sort keep doing that untill the play button comes up toget 3 stars
327,negative,good and bad it has virus!!!!!!!!!
328,positive,great app  major glitch the update was nice  but it prevents my phone from going to sleep  even when the app isn't open. uninstalling the app fixed it  but i miss it. this app alone cut my battery life by more than 20%
329,positive,good app it's customizable which i like. sometimes it's a bit difficult getting items to line up properly and the areas for each part of the display don't change size dynamically so the font sizes will get bigger or smaller to fit in the space alloted for them which i don't like. overall it's a good app though.
330,neutral,battery issues. the app will usually consume 20-25% of my battery. constantly having to force stop.
331,positive,? cute but eats up alot of battery.
332,negative,"needs work there should be a way to adjust the shape and location of the eyes  cheeks  and lips. everyone's features are not shaped the same. even with a well-lit picture taken at the right angle  your app proves inaccurate. which is highly disappointing  seeing as you are a ""big name"" cosmetic brand and not some rinky dink developer making a cheap  advertising heavy app for little girls. i expected more from mary kay  and this type of one-size-fits-all lack of attention to detail and diversity  makes you look bad."
333,positive,ads great app but the ads come up all the time and it ruins it
334,negative,amazing  well designed  but confusing. says i have a lot more free space than android reports.
335,positive,"if only... i'm using this app on a note 10.1 and have also tried the obvious competition.   there are some features i really like and already miss in other apps  especially the very well implemented blending and the in-depth controls for setting pressure sensitivity. the deal breaker for me  at the moment: noticeably worse brush lag than in other apps. note: there is actually a ""note mode"" which limits the area to the current tile and is much smoother  but offers only a small selection of tools while active. i'd love to have that kind of performance with the full functionality (within reason when it comes to more demanding / bigger brushes).  short version: love nearly everything about it and will definitely buy the full version when the performance gets improved."
336,negative,regret buying this app fcs so randomly that it's almost impossible to use it for longer period of time.  lack of updates have made it even more impossible to use.  haven't seen even a single much requested feature by the community being implemented in this app despite being ok play store for more or less 4 months now.  disappointed.
337,negative,? fails to download  phone has sufficient memory and specs!
338,positive,slow  no point. the viewfinder display is really laggy and slow.  doesn't seem to offer any creative black and white features so how does it improve over just desaturating color photos?
339,negative,? convenient but very unfriendly to the battery
340,negative,pages don't fill the screen well  with the latest update i'm now able to sign into the app on my galaxy s4  and it's considerably more stable and responsive on my nook hd+  but unfortunately now when i try to read comics the pages only take up about 2/3 of the screen's available real estate with black borders on the left  right  and bottom.  even if i pinch zoom to fill the screen  when i move to the next page it goes back to the original size.  hopefully they can address that issue and then start adding some of the other standard features of comic readers.  update 8/26/13: today's update still doesn't resolve the issue with comics rendering in about 2/3 of the screen.  while i'm happy to see that they've doubled the number of issues you can have offline  the first time i tried to open one the app crashed back to the launcher.  all in all  this app is still completely unusable on android imo.
